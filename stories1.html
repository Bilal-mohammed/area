    <h5 style="text-align: left;">01/22/2020</h5>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">the uprisings in Iraq</h3>
    <p id="d3e6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Since the 1st of October 2019, a series of protests and violent demonstrations have swept public spaces in Iraq, with demonstrators demanding access to employment, an end to corruption at governmental level and an improvement of public services.</p>
    <p id="b2e2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Women and men&rsquo;s demands were met with violence and cruelty by armed forces and silence by the government. Western media outlets have been turning a blind eye on the continuous brutality used by police and security forces against those occupying the streets to fight for the future of their country.</p>
    <p id="071e" data-selectable-paragraph="">AYS has reached out to local activists in Baghdad in order to spread their voice to the unresponsive Western countries. As of now, we have managed to retrieve data and information, concerning the uprising, for the month of October, as well as brief updates for the month of November.</p>
    <h2 id="5406" data-selectable-paragraph="">1st of October &mdash; Bab al-Sharqi/al-Tahrer square (Baghdad):</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li id="e771" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Est. 2000&ndash;2500 demonstrators were present in the square (70&ndash;100 women; 150&ndash;200 minors).</li>
    <li id="4d99" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Est. 150&ndash;200 the number of armed forces present in the same area, equipped with automatic machine guns, CS gas grenade (tear gas) and sound bombs; 2 police vehicles with water cannons and some armoured vehicles.</li>
    <li id="4aaa" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Protestors were throwing small rocks.</li>
    <li id="4dc9" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">10&ndash;25 people were arrested.</li>
    <li id="e4c8" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Est. 400 + protestors were injured (mainly as they were hit by sound bomb fragments).</li>
    <li id="c31e" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Est. 5 people died during the protests in the same day (3 from gunfire injuries and 2 as they were hit by sound bomb fragments).</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
    <p id="67d0" data-selectable-paragraph=""><br />Demonstrators gathered with more than 2,000 people in Tahrir Square, demanding real government reform after one year of the government, without any progress, and stopping the assault on the graduates and the poor who live in areas where there is a clear housing emergency. They headed towards the Green Zone at 1 pm and across the bridge of the Republic and in the gates of the Green Zone were confronted violently by armed forces. They used live ammunitions, tear gas grenades and sound bombs directly on the people. Three protestors were killed and the others were followed for two kilometres while they were running away. In the meantime, 400 people were injured, some of them would remain permanently disabled.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li id="4423" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">The government did not admit to suppressing the protests and said the demonstrators were &ldquo;Zaatout&rdquo;, which means the little one who does not understand.</li>
    <li id="d2ed" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Some members of the police patrol in Tahrir were suffocated by tear gas and withdrew from their barracks; the demonstrators took them to the closest ambulance.</li>
    <li id="0553" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">With 5 killed, 400 injured and young people arrested, this first day of the uprising resulted in public outrage in all of Iraq&rsquo;s provinces and served as a call to come out against government repression and disenfranchisement.</li>

    <blockquote>
    <p id="b50d" data-selectable-paragraph=""><br />Protestors gathered more than 4,000 people near the public square, trying to push the combined forces back and be able to demonstrate freely, but they were faced with excessive violence. Authorities used live ammunitions, tear gas and sound bombs directly at the demonstrators. Seven protesters were killed and some protesters arrested. In the meantime, 300 people were injured, some of them with permanent physical damages. After that, Internet was cut in all of Iraq for four days, except the Kurdistan region.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li id="3cb3" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">The government commented: &ldquo;The overthrow of the regime is not a legitimate requirement&rdquo;. This vision was supported by other political parties.</li>
    <li id="f547" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Citizens went out and sought revenge for the martyrs. Others contributed by providing drinking water and Pepsi to mitigate the impact of the tear gas.</li>
    <li id="b25d" style="list-style-type: disc;" data-selectable-paragraph="">As the government continued to deal with the demonstrators violently, the Iraqi people declared that its status was illegitimate, and that they should be removed from power and put on trial for corruption and crimes.</li>
